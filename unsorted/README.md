# Information

This folder is currently unsorted, as such it contains folders that I have no idea what category to put them under.

# Todo

Sort the folders and put the things into correct categories.

Make the scripts be runable through command line rather than need hard coding to be done in order to execute.

# Content of Folder

- **Wordfreq**
  Contains a lone script that was created to complete an assignment.
  It is used to figure out how often words appear in a string given to it.
  Needs stuff to be altered inside the script to run correctly.
