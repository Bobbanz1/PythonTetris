# Information

This folder is currently unsorted, as such it contains folders that I have no idea what category to put them under.

# Todo

Sort the folders and put the things into correct categories.

Make the scripts be runable through command line rather than need hard coding to be done in order to execute.

# Content of Folder

- **Gendoc**
  Contains a bunch of scripts once used to complete an assignment.
  The scripts are supposed to be used to create a document in either markdown or HTML.
  **Todo:**
  Need to figure out how to develop it further into something that has a user interface perhaps.

- **Wordfreq**
  Contains a lone script that was created to complete an assignment.
  It is used to figure out how often words appear in a string given to it.
  Needs stuff to be altered inside the script to run correctly.
